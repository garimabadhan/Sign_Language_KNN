# Sign_Language_KNN
Motion of any body part like face, hand is a form of gesture. Here for gesture recognition we are using image processing and computer vision. Gesture recognition enables computer to understand human actions and also acts as an interpreter between computer and human. This could provide potential to human to interact naturally with the computers without any physical contact of the mechanical devices. Gestures are performed by deaf and dumb community to perform sign language. This community used sign language for their communication when broadcasting audio is impossible, or typing and writing is difficult, but there is the vision possibility. At that time sign language is the only way for exchanging information between people. Normally sign language is used by everyone when they do not want to speak, but this is the only way of communication for deaf and dumb community. Sign language is also serving the same meaning as spoken language does. This is used by deaf and dumb community all over the world but in their regional form like ISL, ASL. Sign language can be performed by using Hand gesture either by one hand or two hands. It is of two type Isolated sign language and continuous sign language. Isolated sign language consists of single gesture having single word while continuous ISL or Continuous Sign language is a sequence of gestures that generate a meaningful sentence. In this report we performed isolated ASL gesture recognition technique.
