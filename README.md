# Sign_Language_KNN
Sign language, which involves gestures combining hand-shapes, orientation and movement of the hands, instead of sounds, is the main mode of communication among 
people with hearing difficulties. However, their interaction with other non-deaf people is a grave issue. Most people are unaware of the language and fail to understand what deaf people try to express. Deaf people have a lot to offer and it's a shame when communication becomes a barrier. With the advent of dynamic technology, it becomes 
imperative to bridge this gap and make them feel a part of our society.
